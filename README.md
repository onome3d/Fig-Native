# FigNative - Figma to React Native Code Generator Plugin

FigNative is a Figma plugin that automatically generates React Native code for your Figma designs. It supports a wide range of components, such as frames, rectangles, groups, text layers, buttons, and more.
Features

    Automatically generate React Native code for selected Figma layers
    Supports most basic Figma elements, including frames, rectangles, groups, text layers, and buttons
    Real-time updates whenever changes are made to the selected Figma layers
    Handles auto-layout configurations
    Generates color, border, and padding styles for your React Native components

Installation

   *  Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file.
    * In Figma, open the Plugins panel.
   *  Click on the "+" icon next to "Development" in the left sidebar.
    * Click "Link existing plugin" and select the "manifest.json" file in the downloaded repository.
   *  The plugin, FigNative, should now be available under "Development" in your Figma Plugins panel.

Usage

   - Select a Figma layer that you want to generate React Native code for.
   - Open the FigNative plugin.
   - The generated React Native code will be displayed in the plugin's UI. You can copy the code and use it in your React Native projects.
   - Whenever you make changes to the selected Figma layers, the plugin will automatically update the generated React Native code.

Limitations

   - This plugin does not support every possible Figma element, and more complex designs may require manual adjustments to the generated code.
    - The plugin may not handle every possible layout configuration. Some manual tweaks to the generated code might be necessary in certain cases.
   - The generated code is not optimized for performance and should be reviewed before using it in production applications.

FigNative Roadmap: Upcoming Features and Improvements

    * Nested Components Support: Enhance the plugin to support Figma components and instances, preserving the component structure in the generated React Native code.

    * Responsive Layouts: Add support for generating responsive designs that automatically adapt to different device sizes and screen orientations.

    * Export Images and Assets: Automatically export images and other assets used in the Figma design, and generate the appropriate code to include them in the React Native project.

    * Custom Component Mapping: Allow users to map Figma elements to their own custom React Native components, providing better integration with existing design systems and component libraries.

    * Variant Support: Implement support for Figma variants, making it easier to generate code for different component states or themes.

    * Optimized Code Output: Improve the generated code to follow best practices and performance optimizations, making it production-ready out of the box.

    * Style Export: Export styles (e.g., typography, colors, and spacing) as reusable constants or theme configurations for the React Native project.

    * Animation Support: Detect and convert Figma animations and transitions to their equivalent React Native Animated or Lottie animations.

   *  Integration with Popular React Native Libraries: Automatically generate code that integrates with popular React Native libraries like React Navigation, Redux, or MobX.

   *  Plugin Configuration: Allow users to configure various aspects of the code generation, such as indentation, quotes, and file formats.

   *  Batch Export: Enable users to select multiple Figma layers at once and generate code for all of them simultaneously, speeding up the development process.

   *  Platform-Specific Code: Generate platform-specific code (iOS and Android) based on the Figma design when needed.

    * Figma Design Tokens Support: Automatically extract and utilize design tokens from Figma, making it easier to maintain a consistent design system.

   *  Improved Error Handling and Feedback: Provide better feedback and error handling when encountering unsupported elements or issues during code generation.

   *  Code Preview: Add a live preview of the generated React Native components directly within the Figma interface, helping users to visualize the final output.
